Vandelay Financial Corporation
Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Compliance Policy

Purpose and Scope:
This policy establishes the Anti-Money Laundering compliance framework for Vandelay Financial Corporation. As a US-based commercial bank, Vandelay must implement robust AML programs in accordance with the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), USA PATRIOT Act, and FinCEN regulations.

Customer Due Diligence (CDD) Requirements:

1. Standard Due Diligence:
- Verify customer identity using government-issued identification
- Obtain and verify business registration for corporate customers
- Understand the nature and purpose of the business relationship
- Conduct ongoing monitoring of transactions
- Document customer risk assessment (Low, Medium, High)

2. Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD):
Required for high-risk customers including:
- Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) and their associates
- Customers from high-risk jurisdictions (Cyprus, Cayman Islands, British Virgin Islands, UAE, Panama)
- Complex ownership structures with multiple layers
- Customers with undisclosed or unclear beneficial ownership
- Import/export businesses with high-value international transactions
- Customers whose transaction patterns are inconsistent with their stated business purpose

Know Your Customer (KYC) Requirements:
All customers must complete KYC verification before account opening. Customer profiles must include:
- Full legal name and date of birth (individuals) or registration details (corporations)
- Residential/business address and nationality/jurisdiction
- Source of funds and source of wealth documentation
- Expected transaction patterns and volumes
- Beneficial ownership information for corporate accounts (25% or more ownership threshold)
- Risk assessment classification (Low, Medium, High)

Transaction Monitoring:
Vandelay Financial employs automated transaction monitoring systems to detect:
- Large cash transactions (over $10,000 require Currency Transaction Report)
- Structuring patterns (multiple transactions just below $10,000 reporting threshold)
- Wire transfers to/from high-risk jurisdictions
- Unusual transaction patterns inconsistent with customer profile
- Rapid movement of funds (in-and-out patterns)

- Transfers between accounts with common beneficial ownership in different jurisdictions
- Use of shell companies or complex corporate structures

Suspicious Activity Reporting:
When suspicious activity is detected, Vandelay compliance officers must:
1. File a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) with FinCEN within 30 days
2. Maintain complete confidentiality of the SAR filing (tipping off is a federal crime)
3. Retain all supporting documentation for a minimum of 5 years
4. Cooperate fully with law enforcement investigations
5. Consider account relationship termination for repeated suspicious activity
