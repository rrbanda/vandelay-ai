Migration Prerequisites Checklist

BEFORE YOUR MIGRATION WINDOW

Complete these items before your scheduled migration window begins.
Allow sufficient lead time for items requiring service requests.

SECTION 1: IDENTIFY YOUR MIGRATION PATH

[ ] Confirm your source cluster (VMware OpenShift cluster name)
[ ] Confirm your destination cluster (BareMetal OpenShift cluster name)
[ ] Note your migration phase (DEV, UAT, or PROD wave)
[ ] Note your migration window dates

SECTION 2: NETWORK CONNECTIVITY (Lead time: 14 days)

[ ] Identify all internal systems your application connects to:
    - Databases
    - SFTP servers
    - Message queues (MQ)
    - Mainframe systems
    - Internal APIs
    - Monitoring systems

[ ] For each internal system:
    - Document the destination hostname/IP and port
    - Document the protocol (TCP/UDP)
    - Confirm the current EgressIP is whitelisted

[ ] Get your new destination EgressIP from the cluster configuration
[ ] Submit firewall requests for all internal system connections
    Note: Internet-bound rules are handled automatically by Platform Ops

SECTION 3: VANITY URL (Lead time: 7 days)

[ ] Evaluate if you can implement a Vanity URL
    Benefits:
    - No URL changes during future migrations
    - Consistent access pattern for users
    - Easier certificate management

[ ] If creating new Vanity URL:
    - Submit DNS registration request (branded) or
    - Configure via DNS management portal (non-branded)
    - Map Vanity URL to destination cluster VIP

[ ] If using existing Vanity URL:
    - Plan cutover to point to new cluster VIP

SECTION 4: CERTIFICATES (Lead time: 7 days)

[ ] Review your current certificate's Subject Alternative Name (SAN) list

[ ] If ONLY Vanity URLs in SAN:
    - No action needed
    - Existing certificate will work

[ ] If cluster-based routes in SAN (e.g., apps.vmware-cluster.example.com):
    - Request new certificate with updated SAN list
    - Include destination cluster route patterns
    - Update deployment configuration with new certificate reference

SECTION 5: SSO CONFIGURATION (Lead time: 7 days)

[ ] Identify your SSO provider (Modern SSO or Legacy SSO)

[ ] Get the SSO registration hostname for your destination cluster
    (Available in cluster configuration)

[ ] If using Vanity URL:
    - No base URL changes needed
    - Still need to register with new SSO host

[ ] If using cluster-based route URL:
    - Submit SSO modification request to update base URL
    - Update SSO_REGHOST_HOSTNAME in your application config

SECTION 6: STORAGE (No service request needed)

[ ] Identify all PersistentVolumeClaims in your namespace
[ ] Note current storage classes used:
    - thin (vSphere legacy)
    - thin-csi (vSphere CSI)

[ ] Plan updates to use destination storage classes:
    - dell-csm-sc (Dell CSM)
    - sc-ontap-nas (NetApp ONTAP - default)

[ ] For applications using operators (Redis, Couchbase, etc.):
    - Plan to redeploy operator resources on destination
    - Dynamic storage cannot be migrated; will be reprovisioned

SECTION 7: CD PIPELINE

[ ] Identify your CD tool:
    - Enterprise CD Platform (Type A)
    - Legacy CD Platform (Type B)
    - Release Management Tool (Type C)

[ ] Review CD tool-specific migration guide for your tool
[ ] Plan pipeline updates for destination cluster

SECTION 8: OPERATORS (Lead time: varies)

If your application uses any of these operators, submit a ticket to
Platform Ops for installation on destination cluster:

[ ] Redis operator
[ ] Couchbase operator
[ ] Service Mesh
[ ] Other operators (specify in ticket)

SECTION 9: FINAL CHECKS

[ ] All service requests submitted with sufficient lead time
[ ] Team aware of migration window dates
[ ] Rollback plan documented
[ ] Validation test plan prepared
[ ] Communication plan for stakeholders

READY FOR MIGRATION

Once all prerequisites are complete, you are ready for your migration window.
During the window, you will:
1. Update and run your CD pipeline for destination cluster
2. Validate application functionality
3. Perform cutover (if using Vanity URL)
4. Complete checkout testing
