CD Tool Type C - Release Management Tool Migration Guide

OVERVIEW

This guide covers migration steps for applications using the Release
Management Tool (CD Tool Type C). This enterprise release management
platform requires a service request to update cluster configuration.

PREREQUISITES

Before starting:
- Access to the Release Management Portal
- Your application's identifier
- Destination cluster name and API endpoint
- Service request portal access

STEP 1: RAISE MODIFICATION REQUEST

Unlike other CD tools, Release Management Tool requires a formal service
request to update cluster configuration.

1. Navigate to the Service Request Portal
2. Select "Release Lifecycle Management" category
3. Choose "Modification to an existing configuration"
4. This initiates the onboarding template update process

STEP 2: COMPLETE REQUEST FORM

Fill in the required fields:

1. Application Information:
   - Application ID
   - Application Name
   - Contact Information

2. Change Type:
   - Select "Modification to an existing RLM application configuration"

3. Environment Details:
   - Current cluster (VMware)
   - Destination cluster (BareMetal)

4. Justification:
   - Reference the migration program
   - Include your migration phase and timeline

STEP 3: UPDATE ONBOARDING TEMPLATE

Download and update the RLM Onboarding Template:

1. Download the template from the service request
2. Open the "OPENSHIFT" tab in the template

3. Update the following fields:

   OPENSHIFT_HOST:
   - Format: api.<cluster-name>.example.internal:6443
   - Replace <cluster-name> with your BareMetal destination cluster name

   OPENSHIFT_URL:
   - Format: https://api.<cluster-name>.example.internal:6443
   - Replace <cluster-name> with your BareMetal destination cluster name

   OPENSHIFT_HOME:
   - Typically: /opt/oseclient/v3.7/bin
   - This value is standard for all applications

4. Complete any other required fields in the template

5. Upload the updated template to the service request

STEP 4: SUBMIT AND TRACK REQUEST

1. Submit the service request
2. Note the request/ticket number
3. Track progress in the service request portal
4. Approval workflow:
   - Manager approval
   - Application owner approval
   - Platform team processing

STEP 5: VALIDATE CONFIGURATION

Once the request is completed:

1. Login to Release Management Portal
2. Navigate to your application
3. Verify the new cluster configuration appears
4. Check connection status shows healthy

STEP 6: UPDATE DEPLOYMENT CONFIGURATION

After RLM configuration is updated:

1. Review deployment templates for cluster-specific values
2. Update storage class references:
   - From: thin, thin-csi
   - To: sc-ontap-nas or dell-csm-sc

3. Update any hardcoded cluster references:
   - Route hostnames
   - API endpoints
   - Configuration URLs

STEP 7: EXECUTE DEPLOYMENT

1. Initiate deployment through Release Management Tool
2. Select the new BareMetal cluster environment
3. Follow standard release workflow
4. Monitor deployment progress

STEP 8: VALIDATE DEPLOYMENT

1. Verify deployment completed successfully
2. Check all pods are running
3. Validate service endpoints
4. Test application functionality

TROUBLESHOOTING

Issue: Configuration update request rejected
Solution: Ensure all required fields are completed. Check that the
          destination cluster name is correct and cluster exists.

Issue: Connection test fails
Solution: Verify API endpoint format is correct. Check network
          connectivity from Release Management platform to cluster.

Issue: Deployment fails with authentication error
Solution: Service account credentials may need refresh. Contact
          Platform Ops to verify service account setup.

Issue: Cluster not visible after request completion
Solution: Configuration propagation may take 15-30 minutes. Refresh
          the portal and check again.

RLM SPECIFIC NOTES

- RLM requires service requests for any cluster configuration change
- Plan for request processing time (typically 3-5 business days)
- Keep request templates for audit purposes
- Consider this lead time in your migration planning

NEXT STEPS

After successful deployment:
1. Complete application validation checklist
2. Update any external references to the application
3. Coordinate DNS cutover if applicable
4. Schedule source environment cleanup
