Application Validation and Checkout Checklist

OVERVIEW

This checklist guides you through validating your application after
migrating to BareMetal OpenShift. Complete all applicable items before
considering the migration successful.

WHEN TO VALIDATE

- After deploying application to destination cluster
- Before declaring migration complete
- Before deleting source cluster resources

PRE-VALIDATION CHECKS

[ ] Logout working correctly
[ ] Token refresh working (if applicable)

Authorization:
[ ] User roles correctly applied
[ ] Permission checks working
[ ] Access denied for unauthorized operations

Secrets:
[ ] All secrets accessible

[ ] Certificate chain complete
[ ] No SSL/TLS warnings

SECTION 5: FUNCTIONAL VALIDATION

Core Functionality:
[ ] Primary use cases working
[ ] Critical business operations successful
[ ] Data displayed correctly
[ ] User workflows complete successfully

Integrations:
[ ] All integrated systems connected
[ ] Data flowing correctly between systems
[ ] Async operations completing (queues, events)
[ ] Batch processes running (if applicable)

Data Integrity:
[ ] Existing data accessible
[ ] New data can be created
[ ] Data updates working
[ ] Data deletion working
[ ] No data corruption

SECTION 6: PERFORMANCE VALIDATION

Response Times:
[ ] API response times within SLA
[ ] Page load times acceptable
[ ] No timeout errors
[ ] Performance comparable to source cluster

Resource Utilization:
[ ] CPU usage within expected range
[ ] Memory usage within limits
[ ] No memory leaks observed
[ ] Storage I/O acceptable

Load Handling:
[ ] Application handles normal load
[ ] Scaling working correctly (HPA if configured)
[ ] No degradation under load

SECTION 7: MONITORING AND ALERTING

Observability:
[ ] Logs flowing to central logging system
[ ] Metrics being collected by monitoring system
[ ] Traces working (if using distributed tracing)
[ ] Dashboards showing data

Alerts:
[ ] Alert rules configured for new cluster
[ ] Test alerts firing correctly
[ ] Alert notifications received
[ ] Runbooks updated with new cluster details

SECTION 8: DOCUMENTATION

Updates Required:
[ ] Runbooks updated with BareMetal cluster details
[ ] Architecture diagrams updated
[ ] Network diagrams updated (new IPs, routes)
[ ] Disaster recovery procedures updated
[ ] On-call documentation updated

VALIDATION SIGN-OFF

After completing validation:

[ ] All critical checks passed
[ ] Known issues documented with mitigation
[ ] Stakeholders notified of successful migration
[ ] Validation results documented

ISSUES DURING VALIDATION

If issues are found:

1. Document the issue:
   - What is failing?
   - Error messages observed
   - Steps to reproduce

2. Categorize severity:
   - Critical: Blocks business operations
   - High: Significant impact, workaround exists
   - Medium: Limited impact
   - Low: Minor issue

3. Determine action:
   - Fix before proceeding
   - Document and monitor
   - Accept risk

4. For critical issues:
   - Consider rollback to source cluster
   - Raise incident ticket with migration template
   - Contact Platform Operations team

POST-VALIDATION

After successful validation:

1. Run in parallel (if applicable):
   - Monitor both clusters for comparison
   - Identify any discrepancies

2. Plan DNS cutover (if not done):
   - Schedule cutover window
   - Communicate to stakeholders

3. Monitor closely:
   - Enhanced monitoring for 24-48 hours
   - Quick response to any issues

4. Schedule cleanup:
   - Plan source cluster resource deletion
   - Document cleanup procedure
